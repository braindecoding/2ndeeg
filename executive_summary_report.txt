4. CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

DATASET CONSTRAINTS:
- Single subject data limits true cross-subject generalization assessment

- No advanced EEG preprocessing (ICA, CSP, artifact removal)

PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINTS:
- Modest improvement over chance (4.54 percentage points)
- High variability across sessions (CV > 20%)
- Limited generalization between experimental conditions
- Small effect sizes due to challenging classification task
